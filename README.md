# Booking Completion Prediction – Forage Simulation

## 📌 Overview
This project was completed as part of a Forage virtual experience program focused on machine learning applications in business. The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates whether a customer will complete a flight booking based on behavioral and trip-related attributes.


## 📊 Objective
Develop a machine learning model to:
- Explore and clean the dataset
- Engineer relevant features
- Train a Random Forest classifier
- Evaluate model performance using cross-validation
- Visualize feature importance and business impact


## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PowerPoint (for final presentation)
- Git & GitHub


## ✅ Model Performance
- Accuracy: 87%
- Precision: 83%
- Recall: 79%
- Cross-validated Accuracy: 85%

> The Random Forest model provided interpretable feature importances and reliable predictive accuracy.


## 🔍 Key Features Driving Bookings
1. `purchase_lead`
2. `flight_duration`
3. `trip_type_Leisure`
4. `wants_in_flight_meals`
5. `flight_hour_Night`


## 💼 Business Insight
- Longer purchase leads → higher booking likelihood
- Leisure and night travelers are more likely to convert
- Upselling in-flight meals and targeted marketing can improve retention
